# Form Analysis Scripts
These are Zach's second generation form analysis scripts. Some of the scripts are
- repanalysis.py: contains functions for rep analysis. Can be run on its own
- divide_from_sheets.py: attempts rep division using the functions in repanalysis.py
- labeller.py: meant to help us label the reps in the data set manually. So far it just imports them, separate the accel and gyro and then writes that
